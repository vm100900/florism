Florism is a flutter fork to bring glass morphism to everyone, with just a simple extra widget! Wrap your widgets with this to make a glassmorphic card. Here is a example:
<code>
GlassmorphicContainer(
  color: Colors.white.withOpacity(0.2),
  padding: EdgeInsets.all(16),
  alignment: Alignment.center,
  child: Text(
    'Hello, Glass!',
    style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, color: Colors.white),
  ),
)
</code>
